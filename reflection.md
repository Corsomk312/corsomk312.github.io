What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that margin is more about the positioning of your elements, while padding is about the positioning of the content within those elements. You can use either one to space your page, depending on how you want to do it. I used borders to help me see where my elements were when I was sizing them. It helped me to line things up to my wireframe. 

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that it is extremely difficult to get things where you want them, and to get them to stay where you want them when you change the size of your browser. Using Chrome DevTools defintely helped me to see where things were and what changes I needed to make. How positioning and float interact within the page is something I need to work more on, but I feel confident that it is something that will come in time, with more practice.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Color-scheme was definitely the easiest. Everything else seemed to take a few times before I could get it lined up correctly, but I eventually got everything where I wanted to. I think the most difficult was setting up a floating sidebar. I was considering making it a fixed sidebar, but I couldn't quite get it to stay underneath the header and stop once it hit the top of the page. Still, formatting the static sidebar was difficult in and of itself.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that there is a lot more you can do with CSS than HTML. I felt that classes are extremely helpful in streamlining your code, especially for something like a blog where you are going to have similar layouts for different posts. I learned a lot about positioning and using margins/padding to space the content where you want it to go. Also being able to set the width and height of your elements was very helpful in setting things up.
