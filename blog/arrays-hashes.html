				Hello! Welcome back. Today I am going to be talking to you about arrays and hashes, or how to stay organized in the chaotic coding world. When you are dealing with information, especially a lot of it, you are going to have to organize that someway, somehow. Arrays and Hashes offer you a good way to do that. 
				</p>
				<p>First we'll talk about the little brother of lists, Arrays. Arrays are a little more simple in the fact that they just hold information in numeric order. Think of them as a deli ticket count dispenser thing... you know what I mean. The array takes information, assigns it a numbered spot, and holds it. The information at spot 3 is just the information at spot 3. We don't know anything else about it except that it is in spot 3, and it's going to get a half pound of unsalted ham (gross). 
				</p>
				<p>
					So arrays are ordered in this very basic way. They're great for holding information, but the array itself doesn't tell us much about the information that we are holding. It's just got a number next to it and ships it off when that number is called. This is where Hashes come into play. Hashes do essentially the same thing as an array, insomuch that it stores information. Where the hash differs is that instead of using a numbered list to tell you where the information is, it uses something called a key.
				<p>
					A key is, well, just that. It lets you unlock the value (your information) from within the hash. This is great because now you can have a unique key that will lead you information, and you can have the key be whatever you wish. Say I have a list of all the movies I own, and I want to figure out which genre they fall into. I can use a hash to organize them all into one list that will tell me what genre my movie belongs to! Using the name of the movie as the key (Air Bud 3: SuperBark Sunday) and using the genre as the value (Greatest movie of all time) we can then just type in what movie was are interested in and it will give us the genre!
				</p>
				<p>
					Both of these are very viable tools to have and depending on the situation they both have strengths over the other. It is something that you will have to decide on which you would rather use, which comes with practice and experience. But don't worry, I believe in you!
