					The internet. Something most everyone knows of, but probably not too much about how it actually works. Sure, we all have this vague idea about ISPs and connecting to webpages, but the actual ins-and-outs are somewhat of a mystery for the average internet user. I have to admit even I was a little hazy about the specifics of the process, so I decided to do a little research and provide a little more of the advanced basics. All right, all right, we'll go with Intermediate-Basics of the internet. 
				</P>
				<p>
					Let's begin with, well, the beginning. The internet is not one big fancy machine that controls all of the world's internet usage, it is actually a series of machines, called servers. Think of the internet as a straight line, or a wire (which in most cases it is). The wires by themselves don't really contribute much in the way of content, or abilities other than passing information, so we need other machine that connect directly into that wire to provide us with that content. There are our servers, and they are connected directly to the internet. Webpages, databases, and any other information that is available on the internet is stored on these servers, allowing anyone who calls on the correct server location (IP addresses, which I will talk about in a bit) to access the information stored on the server's hard drive. 
				</p>
				<p>
					How does your request know where to go? Well that's where IP addresses are. They are exactly the same as your home address, or your office. An IP address is a unique number code that only one computer/server can have. IP addresses are usually set up as nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn (all numbers), which is a pretty uncomfortable item to memorize anytime you want to go to a website. Instead of having to type in all those numbers, we can give those locations names, like www.facebook.com. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember what I said about servers being directly connected to the internet? Well, your computer is connected indirectly rather than directly. Our home computers connect to the internet through an ISP (Internet Service Provider), which then routes our requests (webpages, emails, IMs, etc) to the proper place around the internet, sometimes having to through another ISP, such as me being on comcast and my mother being on AOL, even though I told her nobody uses @aol.com anymore but she really likes that guy telling her she's got ma
				</p>
				<p>
					So let's recap - The internet is not some all powerful mysterious force created by man to govern over all of the information in the world. It is simply a wire that allows us to send things from point a to point b, albeit through multiple routers and ISPs and whatever else it takes. Each places that connects to the internet has a unique ISP and thus allows for that computer to receive the information it has requested. I hope this was able to give you a little bit more about how the internet actually works, and brings less confusion as to how that Nigerian prince is able to find you wherever you go.
