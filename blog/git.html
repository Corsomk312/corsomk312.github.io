      Welcome to edition 1.0 of my blog! Today I'll be writing about some of what I've learned over my first week at DBC! One of the biggest things I've learned about is what version control is and the benefits of it. It is something that is essential to coding. I guess realistically you could code without it, but that seems to be a dangerous road to go down. One plus of version control is that it allows you to have multiple levels of a safety net. By saving every state of code (a commit) it allows you to revert back in case you make a mistake. Another main benefit is within a team setting. If you have multiple people working on a single project, it helps to allow them all to work independently on different tasks, and then to be able to bring those back into the main branch. It also removes the chance of someone accidentally deleting all of your work, or you doing that to someone else.

        Git helps you to keep track of changes by understanding the state of your last commit, and then seeing which files within the repository have been changed. You add which files are to be tracked and put in for the commit. Git also informs of whether or not you are up to date with the master/origin branch as well.
    </p>

        Using an online repository can really simplify your life, especially when working with a team. It allows you to upload your work, and also allows others to see what you have done, and to add onto your code without worrying about changing your master branch. It also gives you a backup just in case anytrhing does happen to your local repos.

     Hi! So this week I've already learned more than I figured I would, and I know it's only the basics of the basics. Still it feels really good to be working on something interesting again. One main thing I learned about was version control. It is a practice of paramount importance within the development world. Version control helps to simplify breaking down the workload between multiple users. Using clear, concise commit messages, it allows you to maintain code clarity. It also gives you the freedom to be creative with new code, without the fear of destroying everything that you've already worked so hard to write.

        Git helps you keep track of changes by comparing files from your last commit to the files you have worked on, added, and tracked since then. It also remembers every single time you save. It doesn't operate like a Microsoft Word file, where it just saves over your old file. It remembers the code at each specific save point, and allows you to jump back if you made a mistake. It remembers the code for what it was, and also for what it has become.
    <p>
        Using a utility like GitHub to store your code online is great for sharing your ideas within the community. It also allows for people to fork (copy) your code and work on it themselves without doing anything on the original. It is an amazing resource for when you are working in a team environment. It allows for multiple people to pull from one section of code to work on new code at the same time, without having to worry about someone accidentally deleting a segment you are currently working on.
