     Hi! So this week I've already learned more than I figured I would, and I know it's only the basics of the basics. Still it feels really good to be working on something interesting again. One main thing I learned about was version control. It is a practice of paramount importance within the development world. Version control helps to simplify breaking down the workload between multiple users. Using clear, concise commit messages, it allows you to maintain code clarity. It also gives you the freedom to be creative with new code, without the fear of destroying everything that you've already worked so hard to write.

        Git helps you keep track of changes by comparing files from your last commit to the files you have worked on, added, and tracked since then. It also remembers every single time you save. It doesn't operate like a Microsoft Word file, where it just saves over your old file. It remembers the code at each specific save point, and allows you to jump back if you made a mistake. It remembers the code for what it was, and also for what it has become.

        Using a utility like GitHub to store your code online is great for sharing your ideas within the community. It also allows for people to fork (copy) your code and work on it themselves without doing anything on the original. It is an amazing resource for when you are working in a team environment. It allows for multiple people to pull from one section of code to work on new code at the same time, without having to worry about someone accidentally deleting a segment you are currently working on.
