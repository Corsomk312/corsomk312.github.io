      Welcome to edition 1.0 of my blog! Today I'll be writing about some of what I've learned over my first week at DBC! One of the biggest things I've learned about is what version control is and the benefits of it. It is something that is essential to coding. I guess realistically you could code without it, but that seems to be a dangerous road to go down. One plus of version control is that it allows you to have multiple levels of a safety net. By saving every state of code (a commit) it allows you to revert back in case you make a mistake. Another main benefit is within a team setting. If you have multiple people working on a single project, it helps to allow them all to work independently on different tasks, and then to be able to bring those back into the main branch. It also removes the chance of someone accidentally deleting all of your work, or you doing that to someone else.

        Git helps you to keep track of changes by understanding the state of your last commit, and then seeing which files within the repository have been changed. You add which files are to be tracked and put in for the commit. Git also informs of whether or not you are up to date with the master/origin branch as well.

        Using an online repository can really simplify your life, especially when working with a team. It allows you to upload your work, and also allows others to see what you have done, and to add onto your code without worrying about changing your master branch. It also gives you a backup just in case anytrhing does happen to your local repos.
