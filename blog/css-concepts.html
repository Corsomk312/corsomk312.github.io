					Hi! So this week we learned a little bit about CSS. I say a little bit because well, in the grand scheme of it there is way more that I don't know about than I do. With that being said, I am proud of all that I did learn! So I want to write a little bit today about margins, border, and padding.
				</P>
				<p>
					So a webpage is broken down into elements, with each element having it's own allocated space taken up on the webpage. This is determined by height/width parameters, but we won't get into that. Just know that there is a finite amount of space each element takes up. Each one of these elements has 4 sections to it. First is the content, which is the stuff you actually see on the webpage, be it a picture or some text or links. The content is the stuff you care about, since it what you are displaying for the whole world to see. So consider the content a crock-pot that you ordered from amazon for your mom's birthday (which you forgot was tomorrow so you had to pay for overnight shipping, way to go!). It's going to be placed inside of the box, which we can liken to the element you are maneuvering around. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/images/boxdim.png">image </a>helped me to visualize how the other 3 things (margin, border, padding) work in relation to each other. Margin forms the outer buffer between other elements on the page outside of your border. So if you want somet space between your content and things outside your element, such as the edges of the page. You can use margin to provide a little bit of breathing room. The margin would be like if amazon wrapped the outside of your package in 3-inches of tempered steel... okay fine, how would you open that? We can change it to bubble-wrap, you 'realist'. The bubble-wrap would provide a space on the outside between your crock-pot and the other packages, just like the border provides spacing between it's element and neighboring elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					The border provides the line between your padding and your margin. If you want to box in your content, whether for aesthetics or to help you while you're setting up your elements, you would use your border. Now sometimes your border can seem like it's crowding your content, so this is where the padding comes in. The border would relate to the thin cardboard your wonderful mom's birthday present is going to come in. It lets you know exactly the space your element is occupying. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The padding comes between the content and the border. The padding provides an extra buffer once you have your elements aligned with their neighbors the way you want them to. You may still think that your content is too close together, so you can use the padding to manuever your content how you'd like. The padding is much like everyone's favorite part of ordering things online, the bubble-wrap on the inside of the package. It provides a layer between your border (cardboard box) and your content (beautiful $20 crock-pot). You can do this to avoid cramming your content next to another element, or if your margins are where you want, and it still feels a little cramped for the content. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Margin, border, and padding is a fairly basic concept of spacing, but believe me when I say when you're working with it it's tough to keep everything in it's place. You definitely want to have a firm understanding of this concept before you start experimenting with it yourself, but I will say that experimenting with it is the only way to get an actual understanding of it. Hope you learned a little something today! I also hope you realized that your mom already has a crock-pot... that you gave her for her birthday 3 years ago... and Christmas 4 years before that... and that she already had one before you bought the first one. Goodspeed, code warrior!
