					Okay so maybe 'Language Wars' is a bit hyperbolic and just a touch dramatic, but there are many people who would advocate one over the other. Personally, I'm just getting involved with both of them so I have no preference. What I am here to tell you about is how similar they are to each other in certain aspects. 
				</P>
				<p>
					One of the most important things to know about code is how each language stores it information, because in fact the information is all you really have. Both of these languages have a tool called an array, which is a way you can store groups of information together. The downside of the array is that it stores each piece of information in a numeric index, which isn't exactly great if you need to have more than one pieces of information stored. Also if you want to organize your information in a more specific manner. There is a way to do this though! With a array-esque tool called a Hash in Ruby and an object in JS.
				</p>
				<p>
					What these tools do is they file away information in pairs of two, one as the key and the other as the value. So if you want a certain value, you can unlock that value with it's key. Pretty clever wordplay, eh? I think so. While you can access and modify these in similar fashion, there are some fundamental difference between the two. A Hash in ruby is actually an instance of class Hash, whereas an object in JS is well, an object. With the class in Ruby, this just means it inherits a bunch of properties and methods from it's parent when you create a new instance. JS does not have specified classes, so which methods you use depends on what kind of object you are creating. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You can then get into the differences between classes and constructors in JS, which allows JS to organize in a somewhat similar way to the class structure in Ruby. As I mentioned before Ruby inherits from it's parent class, whereas JS does not. When you create a constructor in JS, you can create what's called a prototype. Unlike the class in Ruby, a prototype has no inherited methods or properties, so you can make an object in JS be a prototype.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I said earlier, I am just getting involved in these two, so there's no way I can make a decision on which is more right or which is easier. I'm fairly certain it might all be a personal choice, or maybe nobody likes either one. I really don't know yet, but I am excited to keep learning and figure it all out!
