					In the world of big data, it is increasingly importat to find efficient ways of sorting through that information. One way to do this would be to type in your long-hand code for every time you want to sort through your information. This would work, but it would add a lot of unnecessary code to your program. Thankfully, the wonderful brains behind Ruby thought of this! They created a module called 'Enumerable', which defined means "able to be counted by one-to-one correspondence with the set of all positive integers". When you think about it in terms of your code, that translates to pretty much the same, you are going through all your information one at a time and applying some code block to it to achieve what you want to.

					One of the first enumerable methods I learned about was #map. Map is a method that has 2 names, and the other name is collect. These two methods do the same thing, but as in most things Ruby related, there is always more than 1 way to skin the proverbial cat (what a morbid metaphor). Well what does map do? No, it doesn't draw you a cool subway map of your code or your information. It will run your specified code block, or the changes you want to make to your information, and return an object containing the results of your mapping. You can use this to manipulate information based on whatever your needs are. 
				</p>

					While to me it seems that #collect seems to be a more accurate description of what you're doing, #map is the more convential method to use. This is going to be a very vague sentence, but if you want to do anything to everything in a group of information, you're going to use an enumerable. There are plenty of methods to look over and understand, and they will do nothing but make your life easier..
