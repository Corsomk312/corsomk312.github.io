	<!-- Insert our reflection here
	##How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	I really enjoyed this process with a pair vs on my own. When it comes to being creative I work best bouncing ideas back and forth with anothe person. I also think Max is very good at aesthetically pleasant things. I enjoy paired coding as well, it's good to have a second point of view to challenge your thought process as well as show you different ways of solving the same problem.

	##
	Did you find wireframing to be helpful in your development process?
	
	Yes I did find it very helpful. It was good to have the basic idea physically in front of you before you start building the html. It allows you then to plan how you want to code it. It was also good to be able to see where you are and what you have left. 

	##What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
	We figured that a good wireframe is one that is easy to read and understand, and very clear in showing what your site is going to do. It allows for visualization of colors in your head, but it shows the functionality of the site more so than anything else. 

	##What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
	I learned that you can have an image aligned, sized, and have text flowing right around it. Other than that everything was pretty straight-forward.
