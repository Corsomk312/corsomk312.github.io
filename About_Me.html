			A long time ago, on an east coast far, far, away.... Okay fine maybe it's not that far away, but I grew up just north of Philadelphia in a town called Levittown. It was one of the first suburbs in America! So you're kind of welcome for all those boring week-nights spent in high school, at least for all my fellow suburbanites.

			I come from a family of 6, and I suffer from a pretty textbook case of lower-middle child syndrome. I have an older sister and brother, and a younger sister. There was definitely always a lot going on in my childhood with the 6 of us in one house, so I understand why I tend to be a little loud now and again. One thing you learned really young was that if you wanted 2nds of any meal, you had to eat fast. Not that there wasn't enough food, but that whole sibling rivalry thing was pretty prevalant at the dinner table.

			Here comes the stereotypes: I enjoy sports (Basketball, Football, Hockey,          Baseball. In that order), Video games, reading, mainly fiction/sci-fi/fantasy, dancing, singing, and learning. While I do enjoy video games, I would not disrespect the term gamer by calling myself one. I am casual-to-mild at best. As for learning, I love learning new things in science fields, and pretty much any news that comes out of the LHC. Ever since I can remember I have been intrigued by outer space. Although when I was young my parents told me about the story of how I was scared during a meteor shower because I thought they were saying 'meat-eater' shower. I legitimately thought that dinosaurs were going to be raining out of the sky to eat us. I guess that's what happens when you let a 6 year old see Jurassic Park in the theaters. Even still I remain ever interested in the universe, even though I realize we will never understand it in my lifetime. I am also ever vigilant for blood-thirsty dinosaurs falling out of the sky.

			I attended an all-boys college prep high school in the Philadelphia area, and attended St. Joseph's University for college. I was a Philly boy through and through. I have a B/S in Finance with a concentration in Economics. I loved the complexity of the financial world and studying macro-economic forces, finding trends and seeing how certain events and decisions affected other markets. I worked a few different jobs my first couple years out of college, and in searching for something I wanted to do, I decided to try my hand at a job within the financial world. I worked in Professional Liability insurance for over 2 years before I decided that wasn't for me. So now I'm breaking into the world of coding, which I can already tell is a better fit for my personality.

			Something I've been pretty proud of is the fact that I have had no cavities in my entire life. Yes. That's right. an adult American male has made it 28+ years with no cavities. I'll be expecting you at my gala honoring me this coming Tuesday. I also have a tendency to just break into different accents, mostly when swearing. **All accents poorly done**, but something about catching someone off-guard with a bad British accent is so hilarious to me. Also, it's not so much that I swear all the time, I feel I have very good swear timing.

			So that's a little about me! As anyone who knows me can tell you, I can talk your ear off (not just about me, I'm not THAT narcissistic) so if you want to know anything or have anything you'd like say. Please shoot me a message! Au revoir.
